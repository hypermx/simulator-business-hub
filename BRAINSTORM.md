## Primary Purpose
The app/website aims to integrate various simulator games into a unified system where players manage their own companies and interact with each other. This cross-game interaction will create a dynamic online environment, enhancing the immersion and engagement of the players.

## Target Audience
The target audience consists of:

- Simulator game enthusiasts.
- People who enjoy optimizing and maximizing efficiency (min-maxing).
- Individuals interested in business management and strategy.

## Problem Solved
The solution will address the lack of interconnectedness between different simulator games. Currently, each game operates in isolation, but the platform will combine these experiences into a larger, cooperative environment. This will create a more immersive and expansive gameplay experience.

## Existing Solutions and Differentiation
While some mods and websites integrate with individual games, the concept stands out by offering a cross-game integration, which is not commonly found. By creating a system where actions in one game affect opportunities in another, the platform offers a unique and compelling experience.

## Key Features
Here are some key features to consider:

- Company Management Dashboard: A centralized hub where players can manage their business operations, track finances, and make strategic decisions.
- Job Marketplace: A platform where player jobs are posted and allow players to take on jobs, connecting different simulator games. For example, a farming job in Farming Simulator could lead to a delivery job in Euro Truck Simulator.
- Custom Mods and API Integration: Custom mods to facilitate the creation of jobs and interactions between games. An API for developers to integrate their games and mods.
- Player Interaction and Competition: Features like leaderboards, achievements, and competitive events to encourage interaction and competition among players.
- Analytics and Reporting: Tools to track performance metrics, financial reports, and other analytics to help players optimize their businesses.
- Community Features: Forums, chat systems, and social features to foster a community of players sharing strategies and experiences.
- Tutorials and Guides: Resources to help new players understand how to use the platform and integrate their gaming activities.

## Platform
Starting with a web-based platform is easier for updates and access from any device. Eventually, we could expand to mobile apps to enhance accessibility and provide a more streamlined experience.

## Monetization Strategy
Here are some potential monetization strategies:

Subscription Model: Offer a premium subscription with additional features, such as advanced analytics, exclusive job listings, and custom mods.
Freemium Model: Basic features are free, with optional paid upgrades for enhanced functionalities.
Advertisements: Incorporate non-intrusive ads, possibly from gaming-related brands.
Marketplace Fees: Charge a small fee or commission for transactions made through the job marketplace.

## Additional Considerations
- Scalability: Ensure the platform can handle a growing number of users and game integrations.
- Security: Implement strong security measures to protect and authenticate user data and transactions.
- User Experience: Focus on a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and engaging.
- Legal and Licensing: Ensure we have the necessary permissions and licenses to integrate with the various games.


## Next Steps
- Prototyping: Create a prototype or MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to test the core features.
- Feedback: Gather feedback from potential users to refine and improve the platform.
- Development: Begin the development process, focusing on the most critical features first.
- Launch and Marketing: Plan a marketing strategy to attract the target audience and build a community.
